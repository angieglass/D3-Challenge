# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler 


You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Creation of a **new** repository on GitHub called `D3-Challenge` (note the kebab-case). Do not add to an already existing repo.

* Completion of all steps in the core assignment

* Coherency of scatter plot (labels, ticks)

* Visual attraction

* Professionalism

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
